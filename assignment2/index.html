Bonus: Website is responsive down to 320px without using @media tags because that's cheating. :D

Project Criticism:  No favicon provided, no title information provided.  Room in footer for validation
buttons, but the example showed none.

			About DevGeek T-Shirts.
		</h1>
		<div class="centertext middlemargins">
			DevGeek T-shirts was an idea conceived after modest success on Kickstarter with a single
			t-shirt called The Super Geek Tee. After realizing there was an underserved market for developer
			themed t-shirts. I came up with a handful of design concepts, elicited help from a good friend
			to film a video, and launched DevGeek T-shirts on Kickstarter in April, 2013. About a month
			later. 469 backers made DevGeek T-shirts a success.
