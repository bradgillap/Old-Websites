Funny story.


I spent quite a while on a Sunday afternoone recreating this based on a photo that was given to me for the assignment. 

I was able to get it to look perfect. One of my colleagues was asking me several questions about the assignment so I sent
him mine for reference to solve his seamingly minor issues. Nieve? Yes of course I was.  Later on in the week I found myself in the coordinators office
signing a paper of academic misconduct for my part in plagerism. I guess my assignemnt made it to several more students.
I received a zero but I'm pretty sure I nailed it. Thankfully it was just a stern warning and wouldn't end up permenently on my transcript. So now, I'm going to share it with the world! HAHA.

Seriously though, I made this myself. Those classmates didn't even end up sticking around the program and failed out adding further
insult to me having to carry the full two year penalty to term.
